# Changelog

All notable changes to this config are documented here.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **99 responses were always empty — root cause: relative `tmp_dir` resolved
  differently by each side of the pipeline.** 99 resolves `tmp_dir` against
  nvim's cwd, but claude (agentic, working on project files) resolves the same
  relative `TEMP_FILE` path against the project directory. Launching
  `nvim Projects/foo/` from `~` meant claude faithfully wrote every answer to
  `Projects/foo/tmp/99-*` while 99 read the empty placeholder in `~/tmp/99-*`
  — generation worked the whole time; the completed responses were found
  sitting unread on disk. Fixed by making `tmp_dir` absolute
  (`~/.cache/nvim/99`), unambiguous for both sides and cwd-independent; safe
  outside claude's cwd because ClaudeCodeProvider passes
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. This supersedes an earlier same-day
  `./tmp` attempt (never pushed), which fixed the system-temp case but still
  broke whenever nvim's cwd wasn't the project root (the plugin README's own
  warning).
  Verified end-to-end twice: a real visual-mode request rewrote the buffer
  correctly with cwd inside the project AND with cwd at `~` mimicking the
  real launch shape.
- **99's logger silently discarded everything**: `Logger:configure` requires
  `type = "file"` for `path` to take effect (the plugin README example omits
  it; anything else falls through to a void sink). With it set, requests
  trace to `/tmp/<dirname>.99.debug` — this log was what exposed the tmp_dir
  mismatch.

### Added
- 99 brought up to the plugin's current recommended shape
  (`lua/plugins/ninety-nine.lua`): `display_errors`, DEBUG file logger with
  `print_on_error`, prompt-buffer completion (`#rules` / `@files`) wired to
  blink.cmp via new `saghen/blink.compat` dependency, and keymaps for the
  newer API — `<leader>9v` vibe, `9o` open last interaction, `9l` view logs,
  `9c` clear previous, `9w`/`9W` Worker search/set-work — alongside the
  existing search/visual/stop/model/provider bindings. All mapped functions
  verified to exist after setup.
- README rewritten to describe this config (Rust setup, bacon-ls, 99 notes,
  keymaps, layout) instead of the stock LazyVim starter blurb.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-03

### Added
- **Live-as-you-type Rust diagnostics via bacon-ls** — the RustRover-style
  always-on inspections. `vim.g.lazyvim_rust_diagnostics = "bacon-ls"` in
  `options.lua` hands the diagnostics role to bacon-ls (LazyVim's rust extra
  disables rust-analyzer's own checkOnSave/diagnostics to avoid duplicates);
  rust-analyzer keeps completion, goto/references, hover, inlay hints, and
  code actions. New `lua/plugins/bacon-ls.lua` configures bacon-ls 0.29's
  native **cargo backend**: clippy (`--workspace --all-targets
  --all-features`) run by the server itself, with `updateOnInsert = true` —
  it mirrors the workspace into a hardlinked shadow under
  `target/bacon-ls-live/`, writes dirty (unsaved) buffers into it on every
  didChange, and re-runs clippy against the shadow, so diagnostics update
  while typing, before any save. `updateOnInsert` must live in
  `init_options`: the server needs it at initialize-time to advertise Full
  didChange sync. Verified headless end-to-end: a clippy-only lint
  (`needless_return`) published on open, and a type error typed into a
  modified, unsaved buffer surfaced as `mismatched types` with zero saves.
- Global bacon prefs (`~/.config/bacon/prefs.toml`, outside this repo) with
  the `[jobs.bacon-ls]` clippy job + `.bacon-locations` export — unused by
  the cargo backend but kept as a verified-working fallback for
  `backend = "bacon"`. bacon 3.25 installed via pacman (Mason's bacon
  package failed to produce a binary; bacon-ls 0.29.0 installed via Mason).

### Changed
- `lua/plugins/rustaceanvim.lua`: dropped the `check` (clippy-on-save) and
  `diagnostics` blocks — superseded by bacon-ls, and they would fight the
  extra's disables. Inlay hints, completion, and import settings remain.
- The `didSave` proxy in `auto-save.lua` is no longer load-bearing for
  diagnostics (bacon-ls listens to didChange, not didSave); kept because
  conform's format-on-save skip still relies on the same mechanism.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-02

### Changed
- **Migrated the whole config from the from-scratch Windows setup to a
  LazyVim-based config on Linux (Omarchy/Arch).** This is a platform lineage
  switch, not an incremental edit — the previous tree (everything under
  `lua/config/plugins/`, the nvim-cmp/mason wiring in `lsp.lua`, and the
  Windows-specific `bootstrap-device.ps1`) is replaced by the LazyVim starter
  (v8) layout with custom specs under `lua/plugins/`. The old Windows config
  remains untouched on the `master` branch.
- **Rust tooling: hand-rolled `lsp.lua` → LazyVim's `lang.rust` extra**
  (rustaceanvim + rust-analyzer + crates.nvim + codelldb via Mason), plus a new
  `lua/plugins/rustaceanvim.lua` override: clippy (`--no-deps`) as the on-save
  check command, native push diagnostics with style lints, inlay hints (closure
  return types, elided lifetimes), fill-arguments completion snippets, full
  function signatures, and module-grouped auto-imports.
- **99 (`ninety-nine.lua`): same settings, different source.** Provider
  (`ClaudeCodeProvider`), model (`claude-sonnet-5`), `--effort medium`, and all
  five keymaps (`9s`/`9vv`/`9x`/`9m`/`9P`) are identical to the Windows config,
  but the plugin now loads from GitHub (`ThePrimeagen/99` with a telescope
  dependency) instead of a local `~/personal/99` clone, which doesn't exist on
  this machine. Keymaps gained `desc` labels for which-key.
- `auto-save.lua` carried over intact (okuuva fork, `noautocmd` +
  `TextChangedI` triggers, and the `vim.cmd` proxy that re-sends
  `textDocument/didSave` after autosaves), now living at `lua/plugins/`.
- `harpoon` carried over as a normal GitHub-sourced spec.
- `README.md` replaced by the LazyVim starter README; `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0,
  from the starter), `lazyvim.json` (extras: `neo-tree`, `lang.rust`),
  `.neoconf.json`, and `stylua.toml` added.

### Added
- Omarchy desktop integration: `omarchy-theme-hotreload.lua` (live theme
  switching), `all-themes.lua`, `plugin/after/transparency.lua`, and
  `lua/config/remote_clipboard.lua`.
- `disable-news-alert.lua` and `snacks-animated-scrolling-off.lua` LazyVim
  tweaks.

### Removed
- Config no longer provides its own `islands-dark` colorscheme, `lualine`,
  `conform`, `telescope`, `treesitter`, `autopairs`, `toggleterm`, `lightbulb`,
  or `misc` specs — LazyVim ships equivalents (or Omarchy theming supersedes
  them, in the colorscheme's case).
- `flutter-tools.lua` and the PowerShell/ESLint LSP wiring — this machine's
  config is currently scoped to Rust.
- `bootstrap-device.ps1` and the OneDrive junction workflow (Windows-only).

## [Unreleased — Windows lineage, superseded by 1.0.0 on this branch]

### Changed
- **`setup-onedrive-link.ps1` replaced by `bootstrap-device.ps1` — a full autonomous
  device bootstrap, not just a link script.** Meant to be run from an elevated shell
  directly off GitHub (`irm .../bootstrap-device.ps1 | iex`) on a clean machine, or one
  with an existing config to replace. Every dependency this config actually needs is
  installed if missing (checked against this real dev machine's actual installed state,
  not guessed): Git, ripgrep, Node.js, Rust (rustup), a C compiler (`BrechtSanders.WinLibs`
  — the actual gcc this machine uses for Treesitter parser builds, not MSVC), Neovim, and
  the Claude Code CLI, all via `winget`; the Flutter SDK via direct download (no winget
  package exists for it — fetched from Flutter's own `releases_windows.json` manifest,
  extracted to `C:\flutter-sdk`, matching how it's actually installed here); the
  `harpoon`/`99` local plugin clones; the PATH entries winget/rustup don't register
  automatically (`.cargo\bin`, the WinLibs `mingw64\bin`, `flutter-sdk\bin`); winget itself
  if even that's missing; and finally the OneDrive link, followed by a headless
  `Lazy! sync` so plugins are ready before the first real launch. Every step is
  independently idempotent (checked via `Get-Command`/`Test-Path` before acting) so
  re-running after a partial failure only does the remaining work.

  **Now prompts before touching an existing local config** instead of silently linking
  over it — detects a non-matching `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim`, asks `[y/N]`, and backs it up to
  `nvim.bak.<timestamp>` before creating the junction if confirmed; aborts with no changes
  if declined.

  Two steps are deliberately left manual since they're credential/GUI flows that
  shouldn't be scripted: signing in to OneDrive, and `claude auth login`.

  Verified: syntax-checked via `[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile`
  before ever running it; ran the full script end-to-end on this real machine (every
  prerequisite already present, so every step correctly took its idempotent skip path,
  down to the exact existing PATH entries and the already-correct junction) with zero
  prompts and zero errors; separately tested the new overwrite-confirmation logic in
  isolation against throwaway fake paths for both the decline path (aborts, no changes)
  and the confirm path (backs up with the original file content verified intact, then
  links correctly) — did not exercise this against the real config to avoid any risk to
  it.

### Changed
- **Config now lives on OneDrive for cross-device sync**, not directly at
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim`. Moved the whole repo to
  `<OneDrive>\cross_device_configs\neovim` and replaced the original location with a
  directory junction pointing at it (junctions over symlinks: no admin rights or
  Developer Mode needed). Neovim needs zero config changes since it still finds
  everything at the default path it always checks — the junction is transparent to it,
  to git, and to every tool that touched this repo throughout this whole log. `nvim-data`
  (installed plugins, Mason tools, undo history) deliberately stays local and unsynced —
  it's machine-specific and `lazy.nvim` rebuilds it automatically on first launch anyway.
  Added `setup-onedrive-link.ps1` (idempotent) for creating the matching junction on
  additional devices once OneDrive has synced the folder there; documented in the README.
  Verified: `Move-Item` initially failed with the folder in use — root-caused to two
  live `nvim.exe` processes plus this very session's own shell having its working
  directory inside the folder (Windows locks a directory while any process's cwd points
  into it, unlike Linux) — closed both and confirmed the move, junction creation, a
  headless Neovim boot through the junction (`colors_name`/`stdpath('config')` both
  resolve correctly), and `git status`/`git log` all working unchanged from the new
  physical location.

### Changed
- **Colorscheme: `rose-pine` → `islands-dark`, ported directly from the user's real
  RustRover "Islands Dark" scheme.** "Islands" itself is JetBrains' 2025 UI-chrome
  redesign (rounded corners, panel spacing) — not a distinct syntax palette — confirmed
  by checking JetBrains' own announcement post, which describes only layout changes and
  publishes no color values. The actual editor colors are still Darcula-derived
  (`parent_scheme="Darcula"` in the exported file). Rather than guess at hex values, the
  user exported their scheme from RustRover (Settings → Editor → Color Scheme →
  Export → `.icls`) and every color in `lua/config/colors/islands-dark.lua` is read
  directly from that file's real hex values — background `#191a1c`, foreground `#bcbec4`,
  keywords `#cf8e6d`, strings `#6aab73`, numbers `#2aacb8`, functions `#56a8f5`,
  constants/fields `#c77dbb`, etc. Replaces `rose-pine/neovim` entirely (dropped from
  `lazy-lock.json`); loaded as a local, non-cloned `lazy.nvim` spec (`dir =
  vim.fn.stdpath("config")`) rather than an external plugin, since it's a one-off port
  specific to this exported theme, not a general-purpose published colorscheme. Verified:
  confirmed `Normal`'s fg/bg resolve to the exact source hex values byte-for-byte, and
  re-ran the same lualine per-mode color-differentiation check from the earlier
  statusline work against the new palette (still passes — `lualine_a_normal` /
  `_insert` / `_visual` all resolve to distinct backgrounds under the new colors).
  `DiagnosticVirtualText*` groups explicitly link to their base `Diagnostic*` groups from
  the start, avoiding the fg==bg invisibility bug rose-pine had.

### Added
- `lualine.nvim` for a real statusline mode indicator. Previously there was no statusline
  plugin at all — the "mode name at the bottom" the user was seeing was Neovim's own
  `showmode` echo-area message (`-- INSERT --`), which isn't colored and only redraws on
  certain events, reading as "stuck." Configured with `theme = "auto"` (derives colors
  from the active colorscheme's highlight groups, so it follows rose-pine without a
  dedicated theme) and `globalstatus = true` (one statusline for the whole editor, not one
  per split). `showmode` turned off since the statusline now covers it. Verified with real
  evidence: confirmed lualine's per-mode highlight groups (`lualine_a_normal`,
  `lualine_a_insert`, `lualine_a_visual`) resolve to genuinely different background colors,
  and confirmed the rendered statusline text switches from `NORMAL` to `VISUAL` on an
  actual mode change (`normal! v`) evaluated via `nvim_eval_statusline`. Insert-mode text
  couldn't be verified the same way — `startinsert` doesn't perform a real mode transition
  in headless Neovim without an attached UI (confirmed separately: `vim.fn.mode()` stays
  `"n"` after it), the same category of headless-simulation limitation noted elsewhere in
  this log — but the underlying mechanism (lualine's `mode` component reads
  `vim.fn.mode()` on every redraw) is identical for all modes, so this isn't a gap in the
  fix, just in what headless automation can simulate.

### Fixed
- **Regression from the previous release: `vim.cmd.helptags(...)` (and any other
  dot-call form of `vim.cmd`, e.g. `vim.cmd.write()`) threw `attempt to index field
  'cmd' (a function value)`.** The `didSave` fix in `auto-save.lua` replaced
  `vim.cmd` outright with a plain function to intercept its string-call form -
  but `vim.cmd` is a callable *table* that also supports dot-access
  (`vim.cmd.write()`, `vim.cmd.help()`, etc.), and a plain function has no fields
  to index. This broke lazy.nvim's own periodic doc-update routine
  (`lazy/help.lua:43: vim.cmd.helptags(...)`) in practice, visibly, in a live
  session. Fixed with a proper `setmetatable` proxy: `__index` forwards dot-access
  to the untouched original `vim.cmd`, `__call` intercepts only the plain
  string-call form. Verified against the exact failing call
  (`vim.cmd.helptags(...)`) plus a couple other dot-call forms, and re-verified
  both the `didSave` notification and the format-on-save skip still work
  unchanged - no regression on the fix this was fixing.

### Added
- `<Tab>` now confirms the selected completion item, same as `<C-y>` - but only
  when the completion menu is actually open; otherwise it falls through to
  normal `Tab` behavior. Standard `cmp.mapping()` + `fallback()` pattern.

### Fixed
- **Still needed to leave insert mode for the didSave fix (above) to kick in.**
  `auto-save.nvim`'s `defer_save` trigger events were `{"InsertLeave", "TextChanged"}` -
  but `TextChanged` only fires for edits made *outside* insert mode; its insert-mode
  counterpart is `TextChangedI`, which was missing. So the debounced save (and the
  `didSave` notify riding on it) never fired while actively typing, only once `Esc` was
  pressed. Added `TextChangedI` to both the plugin's lazy-load `event` and
  `defer_save`. The debounce implementation cancels and reschedules its timer on every
  trigger (confirmed by reading `auto-save.nvim`'s own source), so this doesn't cause a
  save flood while typing - it still only fires ~1s after you *stop*, just without
  needing a mode switch first. Verified end-to-end with `InsertLeave` never fired at
  all in the test: diagnostic appeared in ~1.5s from `TextChangedI` alone.

- **Diagnostics never refreshed without a manual `:w`, even after `update_in_insert`.**
  Root-caused with hard evidence, not guessed: `auto-save.nvim`'s `noautocmd = true`
  (added specifically so autosaves wouldn't trigger format-on-save) suppresses *all*
  autocmds during the write — including the LSP client's own `BufWritePost`-triggered
  `textDocument/didSave`, which rust-analyzer's on-save diagnostic refresh
  (`check.command = "clippy"`) depends on. Confirmed directly: a `noautocmd write` sends
  zero LSP notifications; a normal `write` sends `didSave`. Also confirmed the rest of
  the pipeline was fine along the way - `didChange` fires correctly on every edit,
  document sync is correct (verified via `hover` reflecting brand-new code within
  seconds), and Neovim's own pull-diagnostic auto-refresh is wired automatically on
  attach - the gap was specifically the missing `didSave`.

  Fixed in `auto-save.lua` by wrapping `vim.cmd` narrowly: only for the exact command
  string `auto-save.nvim` builds internally, manually send `textDocument/didSave` right
  after the real (synchronous) write completes - correctly ordered, no vendored plugin
  patched, format-on-save still correctly skipped for autosaves. Verified end-to-end
  with zero manual saves involved: typed an error, waited for autosave's own debounce
  cycle, diagnostic appeared in ~1.5s.

- **Diagnostic virtual text was rendering invisible.** rose-pine's own
  `DiagnosticVirtualText{Error,Warn,Info,Hint,Ok}` groups set `fg == bg` (with a blend),
  so the inline error/warning message text was the same color as its own background —
  the extmark was genuinely being drawn (confirmed via `nvim_buf_get_extmarks`), it just
  couldn't be seen. Its `DiagnosticSign*` groups already correctly link to the fg-only
  `Diagnostic*` groups; extended that same pattern to the virtual text groups in
  `misc.lua`, after the colorscheme loads.
- **Diagnostics appeared to require `:w` to update.** Neovim's `update_in_insert`
  defaults to `false` (diagnostics only redraw on `InsertLeave`, not while still typing)
  — since `Esc` always precedes `:w`, it read as "only updates on save" when it was
  really "only updates on leaving insert mode." Set `update_in_insert = true` in
  `lsp.lua` for RustRover-style continuous feedback while actively typing. Confirmed
  correct against Neovim's own documented semantics for this option; the live
  while-still-in-insert-mode behavior itself couldn't be synthetically verified in
  headless automation (same category of limitation as simulated keypresses elsewhere in
  this project), so this one is verified by mechanism/docs rather than a headless repro.

### Added
- `nvim-lightbulb` — shows a 💡 sign in the gutter whenever a code action (quick fix,
  suggestion, auto-import, etc.) is available at the cursor, same idea as JetBrains'
  lightbulb icon. `<leader>vca` already triggered code actions; this makes it visible
  *when* one exists instead of needing to check manually. Verified end-to-end: set up a
  real local ESLint install + flat config in a test project, confirmed the LSP itself
  flags a real lint violation (`source=eslint code=eqeqeq`), confirmed a code action is
  genuinely offered for it, and confirmed the lightbulb sign gets placed on that exact
  line.

### Verified (no code change)
- ESLint (`vscode-eslint-language-server` via Mason) resolves ESLint from the **project's
  own** `node_modules` — it does nothing without a real local ESLint install and a config
  file (flat config or legacy). This wasn't previously tested end-to-end; confirmed now
  with a real violation caught through the LSP, not just via the CLI.

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- `auto-save.nvim` (`okuuva` fork — the original `Pocco81/auto-save.nvim` has been
  unmaintained since 2024-05) for RustRover-style background auto-save. Configured with
  `noautocmd = true` so debounced autosaves don't also trigger format-on-save; only a
  manual `:w`/`<leader>f` formats. Verified: an intentionally mis-formatted file survives
  an autosave untouched, then reformats correctly on manual save.
- Inline diagnostics styling: virtual text with gutter sign icons (``/``/``/``),
  underline, severity-sorted — matches the inline error-message style from JetBrains IDEs.
- Inlay type hints, auto-enabled on any LSP client that supports `textDocument/inlayHint`.
- Real-time clippy for Rust: `rust-analyzer.check.command = "clippy"`. Verified with a
  clippy-only lint (`needless_return`) that plain `cargo check` never flags.
- `--effort medium` for all 99/Claude Code requests, via 99's own `provider_extra_args`
  setup option (not a source patch, so it isn't lost on plugin updates).

### Changed
- `model` in `ninety-nine.lua`: `claude-sonnet-4-5` → `claude-sonnet-5`.
- `lua/config/plugins/lsp.lua` rewritten to use the native `vim.lsp.config()` /
  automatic `vim.lsp.enable()` flow instead of `mason-lspconfig`'s `handlers` option.

### Fixed
- **`mason-lspconfig`'s `handlers` API no longer exists in the installed version** — the
  custom `rust_analyzer`/`powershell_es` handlers from the original setup were silently
  never called; `mason-lspconfig` now installs servers and calls `vim.lsp.enable()`
  automatically on its own. Found by inspecting the actual installed plugin source, not
  assumed from older docs. Rewired capabilities/settings through `vim.lsp.config()`,
  which deep-merges with nvim-lspconfig's own per-server defaults instead of replacing
  them.
