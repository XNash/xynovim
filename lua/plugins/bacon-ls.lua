-- bacon-ls 0.29+ has a native "cargo" backend that runs clippy itself and
-- pushes diagnostics - no bacon process or .bacon-locations export needed
-- (the older "bacon" backend still works and is configured globally in
-- ~/.config/bacon/prefs.toml if we ever want to switch back).
--
-- updateOnInsert is the RustRover-style part: bacon-ls mirrors the workspace
-- into a hardlinked shadow under target/bacon-ls-live/, writes dirty buffers
-- into it on every didChange, and runs clippy against the shadow - so
-- diagnostics update as you type, before any save. It MUST be set in
-- init_options (not settings): the server needs it at initialize-time to
-- advertise Full didChange sync - and it must stay ON: without it the server
-- advertises no static sync at all and Neovim ignores its late dynamic
-- registration, so saves/changes never reach it and diagnostics never
-- refresh (measured: marker diagnostic never arrived in 300s).
